  This component is heavily inspired by [this block](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063318).

  It is suitable for isomorphic rendering but require to use the
  `Calendar` component not the `ResponsiveCalendar` one.

  This component is available in the [nivo-api](https://github.com/plouc/nivo-api),
  you can [try it using the API client](/calendar/api).
  You can also see more example usages
  in [the storybook](?selectedKind=Calendar&selectedStory=default).

  See the [dedicated guide](/guides/legends) on how to setup
  legends for this component.
