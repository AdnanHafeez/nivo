description: |
  A variation around the [ParallelCoordinates](/parallel-coordinates) component.
  Well suited for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth,
  however you'll lose the isomorphic ability and transitions.

  The responsive alternative of this component
  is `ResponsiveParallelCoordinatesCanvas`.
