  Parallel coordinates chart, supports continuous numerical variables
  and discrete values.

  The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveParallelCoordinates`,
  it also offers another implementation,
  see [ParallelCoordinatesCanvas](/parallel-coordinates/canvas).

  The `@nivo/parallel-coordinates` package also exposes a
  `ParallelCoordinatesLayout` component which can be used to build your
  very own chart. You can see how it's used to build the
  `ParallelCoordinates` component
  [here](https://github.com/plouc/nivo/blob/master/packages/parallel-coordinates/src/ParallelCoordinates.js).
