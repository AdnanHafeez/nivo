description: |
  A variation around the [Pie](/pie) component.
  Well suited for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth,
  however you'll lose the isomorphic ability and transitions.

  The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveCanvasPie`.

  See the [dedicated guide](/guides/legends) on how to setup
  legends for this component.
