  Computes a sankey diagram from nodes and links,
  uses [d3-sankey](https://github.com/d3/d3-sankey),
  see [this block](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/ca9a0bb7ba204d12974bca90acc507c0).
  The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveSankey`.

  Please be careful with the data you use for this chart as it does not support
  cyclic dependencies.
  For example, something like `A —> A` or `A —> B —> C —> A` will crash.

  This component is available in the [nivo-api](https://github.com/plouc/nivo-api),
