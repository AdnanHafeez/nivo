description: |
  A variation around the [TreeMap](/treemap) component.
  Well suited for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth,
  however you'll lose the isomorphic ability and transitions (for now).

  The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveTreeMapCanvas`,
  it also offers other implementations,
  see [TreeMap](/treemap) and [TreeMapHtml](/treemap/html).

  The `TreeMap` component is also available in the [nivo-api](https://github.com/plouc/nivo-api),
  see [sample](/samples/treemap), or
  [try it using the API client](/treemap/api).
