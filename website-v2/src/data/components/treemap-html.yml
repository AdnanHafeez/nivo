  A tree map component using [d3-hierarchy.treemap](https://github.com/d3/d3-hierarchy#treemap),
  see [this block](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/6bbb0a7ff7686b124d80).
  You can fully customize it using `nodeComponent` property to define
  your own node component, if you wish to do so you should have a look
  at [native HTML node component](https://github.com/plouc/nivo/blob/master/packages/treemap/src/TreeMapHtmlNode.js)
  for available properties.

  The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveTreeMapHtml`,
  it also offers other implementations,
  see [TreeMap](/treemap) and [TreeMapCanvas](/treemap/canvas).

  The `TreeMap` component is also available in the [nivo-api](https://github.com/plouc/nivo-api),
  see [sample](/samples/treemap), or
  [try it using the API client](/treemap/api).
