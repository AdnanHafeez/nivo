  A variation around the <Link to="/waffle">Waffle</Link> component. Well suited
                      for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth and does not involve
                      React diffing stuff for children (not that useful when using canvas), however
                      you'll lose the isomorphic ability and transitions (for now).
