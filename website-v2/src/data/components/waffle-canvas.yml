  A variation around the [Waffle](/waffle) component.
  Well suited for large data sets as it does not impact DOM tree depth,
  however you'll lose the isomorphic ability and transitions (for now).

                      You can also see more example usages in{' '}
                      <a
                          href={`${
                              config.storybookUrl
                          }?selectedKind=WaffleCanvas&selectedStory=default`}
                          target="_blank"
                          rel="noopener noreferrer"
                      >
                          the storybook
                      </a>
                      .

                      The responsive alternative of this component is{' '}
                      <code>ResponsiveWaffleHtml</code>, it also offers other implementations, see{' '}
