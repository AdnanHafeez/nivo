  A waffle component.
  You can fully customize it using `cellComponent`
  property to define your own cell component,
  if you wish to do so you should have a look
  at [native SVG component](https://github.com/plouc/nivo/blob/master/packages/nivo-waffle/src/WaffleCell.js)
  for available properties.

  You can also see more example usages in
  [the storybook](?selectedKind=Waffle&selectedStory=default).

  The responsive alternative of this component is `ResponsiveWaffle`,
  it also offers other implementations,
  see [WaffleHtml](/waffle/html) and [WaffleCanvas](/waffle/canvas).
